## URLs

/region/realm/profession1-profession2-profession-3

### Icons

sprite with profession icons

## Local Storage

remember previously selected region/realm & professions => via ACS obj

## Efficiency

reduce TUJ stress as much as possible

=> each realm has its own table that only gets created once it's selected for the first time

=> upon selection, create table / fetch initial data / update existing data if older than 20 minutes
