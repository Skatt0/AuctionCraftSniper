		<p>AuctionCraftSniper allows you to directly compare the total cost of materials with its current corresponding product buyout price, telling you what's worth crafting or sniping and what isn't.
			<br>
			<br>
			All data is taken directly from the Blizzard Auction Data API and gets updated roughly once per hour - more importantly: the page will automatically analyze the newest data if you leave the tab opened.

			Select your realm, the professions you'd like to inspect and an expansion level and you're ready to go!</p>
